# Elk

Complete [LC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) toolchain.
Available as both a [Zig](https://ziglang.org) library and a command-line
program.

[Official Codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/dxrcy/elk)
| [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/dxrcy/elk)

# Usage

```sh
# Show all options
elk --help
# Assemble and emulate
elk hello.asm
# Assemble and debug
elk hello.asm --debug
# Assemble to object file
elk hello.asm --assemble [--output hello.obj]
# Emulate object file
elk hello.obj --emulate
```

## Installation

1. Download the latest binary release from
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/dxrcy/elk/releases/latest).
2. Install the downloaded file to your PATH:

```sh
sudo install <filename> /usr/bin/elk
```

### From source

Alternatively, you can build `elk` from source, only requiring
[Zig `0.16.0`](https://ziglang.org/download/#release-0.16.0):

```sh
git clone https://codeberg.org/dxrcy/elk
cd elk/cli

zig build install -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
sudo install zig-out/bin/elk /usr/bin/
